# Dawn's Recipe Book

For several years now, I've introduced myself as an 'occasional author and kitchen alchemist' when I present.  My method in the kitchen generally involves either adapting recipes that I get from other sources, or throwing the ingredients in my fridge into a pot and seeing what sticks.  As such, I decided that I should maintain a Git repo of my successes, both for my own reference and for sharing with others.

## FAQ

**Q:** Where do you get all of these recipes from?
**A:** Many of them come from people that I know.  Some of them are modified versions of recipes that I pull off the Internet to use up specific ingredients.  Sometimes, I make it up as I go along.  People and original recipes are credited where I've been able to find them.

**Q:** Where's all the meat and dairy?
**A:** I'm vegetarian, save for the occasional portion of salmon, and very lactose-intolerant.  I will cook meat dishes for others, but as I don't eat them myself, I don't often get the opportunity to do so.  I typically substitute dairy for oil, non-dairy spreads, or soy milk.

**Q:** Are these meals nutritionally balanced?
**A:** Probably not - I dread to think what a dietitian would have to say about my food intake.  Maintaining a balanced diet is much easier for meat-eaters.
